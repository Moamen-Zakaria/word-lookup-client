# word-lookup-client

Client that consume lookup api with a convenient UI.

Depend on Material UI, axios.

Dockerized to save environment setup time.

Took longer than expected, because I had trouble setting environment in my personal machine (Installation process of node js and npm is more cimplicated than usual in a Linux system like mine) as I seldom use react in my prsonal computer, I didn't have the environment already.

Also dockerizing the app took significantly long time, because I had connection issue and each time I try a version of a new image version it takes ages to download, beside downloading depenedencies of app before building of image.
